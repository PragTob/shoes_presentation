# Shoes presentation

A presentation about the shoes gui toolkit using the [wingtips] (https://github.com/PragTob/wingtips) presentation kit (written in shoes itself!).

Slides were first presented at JRubyConf 2013. You can watch the video [here](http://media.eurucamp.org/#talk-2013-PragTob)

To run the presentation do `wingtips .` or `wingtips lightning_talk_config.rb` to run the lighting talk version.
